# **Inspirational Quote Bot**
*This code has no liscensing, as I am far too lazy to integrate github with VS code*

## **Settings File**
*I am currently using the settings file WITHOUT labeling, as I am too lazy to make it labeled*
 - Changing the original quotes file
	 - By default, the program is pointed at the `wild-internet-quotes.txt` file
	 - This can be changed by opening `settings.covid`, and changing line 1

## **Log File**
*The program has a rudimentary log file, that works sometimes*
 - What the logs are
	- Currently, the program logs an error when it is being pointed at the wrong file. *did you want more, since it's not coming*
	- They are made up of the current date, followed by the error
	- The errors that I'm logging are pretty self-explanatory, so I'm not going to explain those
**The log is located in** `log.bait`**, which is not a reference to anything in particular, and there is no need to investigate**

## **Other Info**
 - This program is made for use on the Quote of the Week google form for the Cranbury School.
 - If you are reading this, *feel free* to comment on the *horribly innefficient* code, being used for a program that *essentially noone cares about*
 - Please, do not fork this code to make a bot for Music Mondays(?), since **idk actually, but I feel like it'd be funny if I also made the bot for that**
